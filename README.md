# Employee Salary Generator

This project is part of the **C for Everyone: Structured Programming** course on Coursera.

## Description

This code serves as the solution for Week 2's Peer-graded Assignment, which focuses on generating random salaries for employees across various departments. It involves defining a struct that encapsulates department names (HR, Sales, Research, Software, and Executive using enums), annual salaries (as integers), and social security numbers (unsigned integers). The code generates a pool of ten employees, each assigned a unique social security number, and employs a salary generator mechanism for each department. This mechanism combines a base salary with a randomly generated offset. The final output displays the information of all ten employees, with each employee's details presented on a separate line.
